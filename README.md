# 🧭 CNO Track: Full Learning Roadmap  
**With x86 Assembly & Python for CNO/RE**

**Goal:**  
Move from “barely write C” → “can write, exploit, and analyze real-world CNO tooling and malware”

**Approach:**  
Logical sequencing, clear prerequisites, and practical overlap where it *accelerates* skill-building (not just adding workload).

---

## 🚦 Phase 1: C Programming Fundamentals (Weeks 1–12)
**Purpose:** Build strong language fundamentals and mental models for memory, pointers, and bugs.

- **Weeks 1–12:**  
  - Data types, variables, and scope  
  - Pointers and arrays  
  - Control flow, functions, recursion  
  - Memory management (`malloc`, `free`), stack vs heap  
  - Structs, arrays, enums  
  - File I/O basics  
  - Intro to function pointers and callbacks  
  - Debugging: `gdb`, `valgrind`, `objdump`  
  - Safe coding and C “gotchas”  
  - Weekly labs: bugs, buffer overflows, walkthroughs of binary/disassembly

**🏁 Deliverable:**  
A small C app with both intended bugs (buffer overflow, etc.) and a write-up mapping source to binary.

---

## 🚦 Phase 2: Systems Programming (Weeks 13–24)
**Purpose:** Use C to interact with the operating system directly — processes, memory, files, signals, threads, and *intro to sockets*.

- **Weeks 13–24:**  
  - System calls: `fork`, `exec`, `wait`, `open`, `read`, `write`, `mmap`, `signal`, etc.  
  - File descriptors, pipes, `/proc`  
  - Memory management at syscall level  
  - Process creation and management  
  - Signals and signal handling  
  - Threads (`pthread` basics), mutexes, race conditions  
  - **Sockets — Intro only:** 1–2 weeks on basics (`socket()`, TCP/UDP overview, simple client/server)  
  - Syscall tracing (`strace`), ELF basics, privilege escalation basics  
  - Weekly labs: mini shell, process tree, vulnerable syscall-based apps

**🏁 Deliverable:**  
A mini shell (with basic job control) or a syscall-heavy tool, with binary analysis (Ghidra/objdump).

---

## 🚦 Phase 3: Network Programming (Weeks 21–30) *(CAN OVERLAP with late Systems Prog!)*
**Purpose:** Specialize in writing secure, robust, and CNO-relevant network code.

- **Weeks 21–30:**  
  - Deep dive: `socket()`, `bind()`, `listen()`, `accept()`, `connect()`, `send()`, `recv()`  
  - Protocol engineering: TCP vs UDP, custom protocols  
  - Multi-client servers: `select()`, threads, non-blocking I/O  
  - Protocol fuzzing, bug finding, writing and patching exploits  
  - Traffic analysis (`tcpdump`, Wireshark), protocol documentation  
  - Security: buffer overflows in network code, info leaks, protocol confusion  
  - Capstone: full-featured chat server, RAT, or CNO tool with custom protocol

**🏁 Deliverable:**  
CNO-grade server/client pair (robust, well-documented, tested with traffic capture and vulnerability analysis).

---

## 🚦 Phase 4: Operating Systems (Weeks 31–44)
**Purpose:** Learn the **internals**: how the OS works, memory is managed, scheduling, filesystems, kernel security.

- **Weeks 31–44:**  
  - Kernel vs userland, system call flow  
  - Virtual memory, page tables, process isolation  
  - Scheduling, synchronization, semaphores  
  - Filesystem implementation (inode, ext4, FAT, journaling)  
  - Bootstrapping and OS initialization  
  - OS-level security mitigations (ASLR, SMEP, KASLR, stack guards)  
  - Kernel data structures, device drivers  
  - Build/modify a toy kernel (xv6 or similar), or write a basic kernel module

**🏁 Deliverable:**  
Trace and document a privilege escalation exploit, or add a syscall to a toy OS (and exploit/use it).

---

## 🚦 x86 Assembly and Reverse Engineering Fundamentals (Weeks 16–28, integrated/parallel)
**Purpose:**  
Build foundational binary analysis skills, RE, and understand how C compiles to machine code for exploitation.

**Recommended Overlap:**  
- Begin after solidifying C syntax and pointers (around Week 16).
- Integrate with Systems/Networking: Use C programs as RE targets; analyze binaries you’ve built in other phases.
- Not an isolated block: Blend weekly assembly/RE labs into the latter half of C and throughout Systems Programming.

**Topics:**  
- x86 instruction set, registers, stack/heap layout  
- Compilation: C → asm → machine code  
- Basic disassembly (objdump, gdb, Ghidra walkthroughs)  
- Reverse engineering control flow and data  
- Lab: Map source lines to assembly, RE simple binaries, basic exploit dev

---

## 🚦 Python for CNO and RE (Weeks 8–44, continuous integration)
**Purpose:**  
Rapid scripting, automation, and tooling for CNO workflows, including binary parsing, RE scripting, and toolchain integration.

**Recommended Overlap:**  
- Begin during late C (Week 8+): After you’re comfortable with basic programming, start the Python track alongside Systems Programming.
- Continue through Network/OS: Use Python for scripting labs, automating testing, and building RE/analysis tools throughout the rest of the program.
- Apply in every phase: Labs and capstones should increasingly leverage Python for automation, proof-of-concept exploits, and tool integration.

**Topics:**  
- Python scripting for automation, file/binary manipulation  
- Subprocess management, tool chaining  
- Network scripting (client/server, protocol fuzzers)  
- pyelftools, pefile, pwntools, scapy  
- Ghidra/IDA scripting (applied in capstone RE labs)  
- Integrate with CNO workflows as a “glue language”

## Integration Guidance

- Labs and capstones in Systems, Networking, and OS should *require* or *encourage* use of both Python and Assembly tooling for automation and analysis.
- Weekly or biweekly “integration checkpoints”: document how Python or Assembly tooling advanced or accelerated your understanding or workflow.

---


- **Do NOT try to learn all four in parallel.**  
  - *C Programming* must come first (don’t start systems/networking without pointer confidence).
  - *Systems Programming* is a must before deep socket work — but a light socket intro there is fine.
  - *Network Programming* can start as you finish threads/signals/syscalls in Systems Programming.
  - *Operating Systems* is the capstone: do it last, as it synthesizes everything and lets you dive into kernel-level RE, exploit dev, and analysis.

- **Write-ups, labs, and code from each phase should “build into” the next.**  
  - E.g., your C chat server → syscalls and signals → network-enabled version → analyze with Ghidra → understand kernel interaction.

---

*Stick to the order and integration plan above for maximum real-world value in CNO/RE, exploit dev, and advanced security roles.*
